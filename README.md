## Hi there 👋 I'm Josue, a professional Business/Data Analyst
I come from a background in business operations and technical recruiting, where I spent several years analyzing workflows, identifying bottlenecks, and helping companies improve their hiring and project execution processes. 

Currently, as Technical Recruiter within the Life Sciences industry, I’ve partnered with consultants and experts across pharmaceutical and biotech. Through those conversations, I became fascinated by the work happening behind the scenes — the data-driven decisions, analytical problem solving, and measurable impact that analytics professionals bring to every project. That curiosity turned into action when I enrolled the TripleTen Business Analytics Bootcamp, where I've built hands-on experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and visualization tools such as SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI. Through this training, I developed skills in data cleaning, KPI reporting, trend analysis, and turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

Recently, I  competed in a project, as part of a collaborative data analytics externship, designed to explore the claim that: Millennials aren’t buying real estate. Our team analyzed multi-generation housing, income, and mortgage datasets to identify trends, compare buying patterns across age groups, and determine whether the narrative matches the data. Through data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis, we uncovered insights that helped clarify how economic conditions, wage growth, and market dynamics have influenced home-buying behavior.

While I’m still early in my analytics career, I bring mix of analytical curiosity, communication skills, and stakeholder experience from my recruiting background. Once I make a decision, there’s no limit to me wanting to keep learning, improving, and adding value. 

Let’s connect — I’d love to learn from others in the field and explore opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and make data work smarter.
